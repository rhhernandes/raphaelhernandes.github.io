<h2>About</h2>
<p>With over a decade of experience as a journalist and specializing in technology, I am currently a <a href="http://lcfi.ac.uk/people/raphael-hernandes/" target="_blank">Research Assistant at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence (LCFI)</a> and pursuing an MPhil in the Ethics of AI, Data, and Algorithms at the University of Cambridge. My work focuses on the intersections of AI with journalism, the information environment, and geopolitical dynamics, applying my experience in news media and using quantitative methods to address the ethical challenges and opportunities of artificial intelligence in society.</p>
<p>Formerly an editor-at-large at <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/autores/raphael-hernandes.shtml" target="_blank">Folha de S.Paulo</a>, Brazil's leading newspaper, I covered critical topics like AI, cybersecurity, and the metaverse. My initiatives have consistently aimed to enhance business and editorial strategies, evidenced by my leadership in the Google News Initiative Innovation Challenge-winning project, "Voz Delas," which used natural language processing to boost gender diversity in journalistic sources, and in other implementations of data-centric projects in the newsroom.</p>
<p>I have demonstrated high performance in various roles within the newsroom. In addition to my editorial accomplishments, I am experienced in analyzing audience metrics and user behavior, which has deepened my understanding of the journalistic business and strategic landscape. I also run the <a href="https://privacidadeparajornalistas.org/" target="_blank">Privacy for Journalists</a> initiative in Brazil, aimed at raising cybersecurity awareness among reporters.</p>
<p>As a speaker and communicator, I regularly engage with diverse audiences at technology and journalism conferences and have contributed to various media formats. My passion lies in using technology and data to inform, empower, and engage the public while fostering critical and responsible use of AI.</p>
