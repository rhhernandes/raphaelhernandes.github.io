<h2>About</h2>
<p>I am an AI Ethics researcher and journalist specializing in technology and data. I hold a master's degree in Ethics of AI, Data and Algorithms, having graduated with distinction from the University of Cambridge (UK) and winning the Huw Price Prize for best overall performance in the cohort. I currently work as a Research Assistant at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence (LCFI), focusing on media coverage of AI and the usage of generative AI in political communications.</p>
<p>In my journalism background, I worked for some of Brazil's most important news outlets, including as editor-at-large at<a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/autores/raphael-hernandes.shtml" target="_blank">Folha de S.Paulo</a>. Besides reporting on technology and society, I led and implemented data and AI-centric projects in the newsroom.</p>
<p>My research focuses on the intersections of AI with journalism as well as its impacts on the information environment and epistemic security. I apply my experience in news media and use quantitative methods to address the ethical challenges and opportunities of artificial intelligence in society.</p>
<p>As a speaker and communicator, I regularly engage with diverse audiences at technology and journalism conferences and have contributed to various media formats. My passion lies in using technology and data to inform, empower, and engage the public while fostering critical and responsible use of AI.</p>
